Acing the technical interview in JS
===================================



I saw this on https://aphyr.com/posts/340-acing-the-technical-interview

I was amazed by how cool this was so I had to reimplement it. This isn't done
in a fancy language but instead in plain JavaScript. You'll need generators
to run it because I'm lazy.
